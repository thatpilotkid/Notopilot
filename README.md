# Notopilot
Definitely NOT a single axis altitude hold PID controlled autopilot. 

# The Scope
The scope of this project is to design, build, test, and implement a single axis, altitude preselect, autopilot for small general aviation aircraft. The budget for the project is $100 and whatever crap is sitting around my hangar. 

# The Systems
The MK1 autopilot control system consists of a 3 position momentary rocker switch, an arduino uno, a DC stepper motor driver breakout board, a battery system, and a NEMA 17 stepper motor.
